wakaba~kaba is wakaba imageboard script tuned in some places to
improve performance and add a bit of bells and whistles.

To run this version you need a web server, database engine and
perl (probably with cpan because you'll need to install some
modules). I'm develop on nginx and postgres if you care.

Wakaba-kaba now runs on following configs:

---[nginx site]-------------------------------------------------

# TODO: Here we need to add a bit more environment variables.
location ~ wakaba\.pl$ {
     fastcgi_pass   localhost:8888;
     fastcgi_index  wakaba.pl;
     include  fastcgi_params;
     fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME $fastcgi_script_name;
}

location ~ captcha\.pl$ {
     fastcgi_pass   localhost:8887;
     fastcgi_index  index.pl;
     include  fastcgi_params;
}

-----------------------------------------------------------------


---[type in shell to run fastcgi servers]-----------------------

FCGI_SOCKET_PATH=":8887" ./captcha.pl &
FCGI_SOCKET_PATH=":8888" ./wakaba.pl &
